# Inventory Manager: Products and Stock Control

This project implements a basic **inventory management system**, where:

- Products are stored in a **list**
- The stock for each product is managed as a **stack (LIFO)**
- A menu-driven interface allows users to interactively add, view, and remove items

## Features

- Add and view products
- Manage the stock of each product independently
- Add units of stock with randomly generated serial numbers
- Remove stock units in **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order

## Applied Concepts

- **Linked lists** to manage the catalog of products
- **Stacks** to manage product stock entries
- Dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation
